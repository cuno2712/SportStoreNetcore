<p>My application, called SportsStore, will follow the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.
I will create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, a shopping cart
where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details.
I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for
managing the catalog, and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes.</p>
